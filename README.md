# TypeScript Server - Grakkit

A template for server developers who want to take advantage of TypeScript on their Grakkit-enabled Minecraft server.

## Initial Setup

Clone or Download this repository and extract its contents to your server's `plugins/grakkit` folder, then from there, run `npm install`.

## Starting The Environment

Every time you open your development environment, ensure that you have run `npm run tsc` in the `plugins/grakkit` folder. This will initialize the TypeScript environment and begin the auto-compilation process.
